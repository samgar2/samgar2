### Hi, I'm Samantha! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ±  I recently graduated from The Grace Hopper Software Engineering Immersive at Fullstack Academy and am excited to join a software engineering team. At Grace Hopper, I learned full-stack web development with specializations in JavaScript, React.js, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express.js. I developed multiple web applications both individually and on a team, and gained the skills for successful pair programming. 

ðŸŒ¸  My background in digital marketing over the last four years has provided me with an in-depth understanding of the user experience, which I enjoy leveraging as a software developer to help my team maximize product success and write clean and efficient code.
