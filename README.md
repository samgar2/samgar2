### Hi, I'm Samantha! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I'm a UCLA alum with a Bachelor's of Arts in Sociology. I've excelled in digital marketing positions, and also completed a full-time immersive program in full-stack web development specializing in JavaScript, React.js, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express.js. At Gracce Hopper, I built and deployed web applications individually and in teams, gaining experience in collaborative workflows, troubleshooting, and iterative development through pair programming.

ðŸŒ¸ My background in digital marketing over the last four years has provided me with an in-depth understanding of user behavior and data analysis. I'm excited to combine this knowledge with my technical skills to help my team reach our goals and write clean and efficient code.
